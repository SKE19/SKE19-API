## Contribution (or just Building for yourself)
After cloning the repository, you should navigate to your repo folder, and type in terminal:

```
npm install
```

Then, you should make a new `.env` file, here's the emptied environment file:

```
PORT=3000
DATA_PATH=path/to/your/data/file
```

After that, you should be able to start the API by:

```
npm run dev
```
