### Version: 1.1.0

**URL: https://ske19-api.herokuapp.com/**

A web-based RESTful API for querying information of SKE19 students, with AWS DynamoDB for database.

Currently there are only GET routes for this API, more features will be implemented later. The responses of the API are always `application/json`. See below for routes for this API.

## Contribution (or just Building for yourself)
Make sure that you have set up **AWS** with **IAM** user and **DynamoDB**.

After cloning the repository, you should navigate to your repo folder, and type in terminal:

```
npm install
```

Then, you should make a new `.env` file, here's the emptied environment file:

```
PORT=3000
SECRET_IDENTIFIER=key_for_jwt

DATA_TYPE=[FILE|HTTPS]
DATA_PATH=path/to/your/csv

ENABLE_AWS=[true|false]
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=aws_key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=aws_secret
AWS_REGION=aws_region

MAX_DISCORD_COUNT=2
```

After that, you should be able to start the API by:

```
npm run dev
```
